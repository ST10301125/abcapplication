ABC RETAIL APPLICATON

An Overview of the Order Processing System Challenges at ABC Retail

ABC Retail is a quickly growing online retailer that presently uses an antiquated on-premises infrastructure to handle order processing. For the purpose of recording client orders and product information, this arrangement makes use of a standard relational database, which might get overloaded during busy times like the holidays and Christmas.

Furthermore, network shared discs are used to store product photos, which results in inefficiencies and sluggish access times. Due to its reliance on outdated middleware, the current message queuing system is not scalable or reliable enough, which causes processing mistakes and delays in message delivery. As a result, ABC Retail deals with disgruntled customers, lost revenue, and ineffective operations.

Even after migrating their order processing system to the cloud, ABC Retail still has issues with dependable messaging and real-time event processing.
